# COMP3015
**2020-COMP3015-Coursework**

This Project will allow you to inspect the model in various ways, this included throughout the use of differnt shaders, lighting and textures. This project is made up of 6 "Scenes", where the user can view each one, and interact if possable.

**How To Use**
* **Navigate Scenes** >> *1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (Top Keyboard)*
* **Scene 1 or 4 Toggle** >> *Enter = On, Left Shift = Off*
* **Close Application** >> *ESC Key*

**Created Using?**
This application was created on Visual Studio Community 2016 V16.8.4 on a Windows 10 Desktop.

**How the Code Works**
This project uses multiple methods. objects, textures & Shaders. These have been combined in multiple ways, to produce differnt outcomes/styles. The code works but displaying one scene at a time. A run down of what scenes show off what can be found below. This code can easily be navigated as it has been split down into methods, inwhich clearly display what function it serves. Comments are also made througuot the project, to clearly indicate key details.

*Keyboard Numbers 1-6 are used to change scenes. Enter and LShift can be used to toggle options on Scene 1 & 4.*
